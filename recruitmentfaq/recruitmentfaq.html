					<p>A: You should join a business fraternity in order to make your college career professionally worthwhile. While it is possible to obtain various intenships and professional knowledge without the aid of a professional business fraternity, becoming a brother opens the door to our vast alumni network in various industries, professional events, recruitment events to companies such as Deloitte, and community service events to further enrich the college experience. Brotherhood is something that cannot be mimicked, and is one of the most important aspects of the fraternity. Once you join Delta Sigma Pi, you are a brother for life. </p>
