				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1" style="text-decoration: none">How can a joining business fraternity enhance my college experience?</a>
				<div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p>You should join a business fraternity in order to gain professional development outside the classroom setting. While it is possible to obtain various internships and professional knowledge without the aid of a professional business fraternity, becoming a brother has many benefits, including opening the door to our vast alumni network in various industries, access to professional, company recruitment, and community service events to further enrich the college experience. Brotherhood is an experience that cannot be mimicked, and is one of the most important aspects of our fraternity. Once you join Delta Sigma Pi, you are a brother for life.</p>

				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2" style="text-decoration: none">What is the pledging program?</a>
				<div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p>
					The pledge program is designed to build brotherhood and professionalism and prepare each pledge to become a brother in the fraternity. Pledges receive an opportunity to gain exposure to various aspects of the business world through workshops, presentations, interview practice, and more. The time commitment is equivalent to a part-time internship and lasts roughly around eight weeks.</p>

				<div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p>Absolutely! Several brothers have applied more than once before receiving bids. We look at repeated applications as a sign of dedication, persistence, and commitment. Be sure to illustrate how you have developed since last applying and what you have done to get closer to accomplishing your goals!</p>
