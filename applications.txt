I plan to attend, hopefully, all the events. Since I've only attended one so far (being submitting the application Tuesday 7pm) I would like to elaborate on the fantastic experience I had in DSP's very first rush event this winter. I got to talk with many brothers and found it incredible how each and every one of them had different stories to tell. Dylan shared about his experience studying abroad and how his brotherhood in DSP really supported and helped him pull through the hard times abroad. Tyler shared about his competency in time management, but was not afraid to admit a flaw in working "slowly", yet he finishes the final work within his content. Vincent was very enthusiastic about the technical aspects of DSP and really engaged in our computer science and website talks. Jessica emphasized on the close bonding brotherhood DSP has, which I commented is something I appreciate a lot, especially when I know how rare these kind of connections come along. These are just to name a few of the valuable interactions I had yesterday with the brothers. Through the interactions, I can really tell first-hand how genuine and supportive the brothers are. They were not afraid to share their failure but also brought encouragements as they shared about overcoming their flaws and establishing life long lessons through their resilience. I wouldn't imagine how anything would top this -- getting to know these brothers on such a personal level and learning so much from their different experiences. The advices and stories shared in the event were things that are superiorly beneficial for my life, and I plan to keep taking advantage of these opportunities DSP has to offer.  

To me, brotherhood is an everlasting bond built between people through genuine, truthful, and hard-working efforts. It is a unity similar to family. 
I've always treated my friendships with the strong idea that in order to gain a strong bond with my friends, aiming for a long-lasting support, I need to treat them like family. For my family, I am always supportive, inclusive, and prioritizing them as one of the most important aspects of my life. Of course, there are many different people in the world who think differ, but I am seeking those who too believe that friendship requires true sacrifices and support as seen between family members. With those people, I am dedicated to spend time and share my passion with them for a long run. 

If you ask anyone around me, they would probably agree when I say I have always had the quality of going beyond the exceptions of my normal age groups. I got my first job when I was 14 years old, while living alone in a shared-house rent. On top of that, that particular year was the first year I came back to the states after 3 years of staying in my home country, Taiwan. Being in a completely unfamiliar environment and a fresh teenager, I was able to navigate myself smoothly through the transition and build great academic and work achievements throughout. I joined multiple campus clubs and eventually found my own humanitarian club where we sponsor children from around the world to indirectly provide them with health care, nutrition, and education. I was also engaged in the city's established Sustainability Committee and became a committed member my junior year. Through the committee, I was partially in charge of the preparation and planning of our annual Arts and Greens festival as well as providing cognitive advices on how the city could implement environment structures and meet specific criteria. Today, I work hard in establishing myself in the technical field through the study of computer science and cumulating as much insight on different opportunities throughout campus as possible. I also work for DSS IT and the curricular support department in UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Having to gain experience in every opportunity is very much fascinating for me. I never hesitate to share these experiences with others and provide tips and guidances, if helpful. My greatest aspiration is to be able to help people understand their own particular potentials and pursue their passion with ambition and joy. 

After graduating, my goal is to step into the real world and gain a much border sense of life in the perspectives of others and myself. I would love to join a successful company to learn about their reason of success and grow through every opportunity. After being in the work force for a few years, I may consider going to graduate school to focus on a degree I'm passionate about, -- which I have not found yet -- but I can guarantee if I do realize my truest passion, I will pursue it through a higher degree. Finally, I would like to give back to society by either building my own humanitarian outreach facility or first-hand support an established non-profit organization. My hope is that DSP would be a big stepping stone to any one of my goals in the future, as I grow through pledging and all the experiences DSP has to offer.    

I am relatively great at balancing my commitments through organized scheduling and utilizing every minute of my time efficiently. Having the opportunity to work and live independently for a period of time in high school, I developed a superiorly strong time management skill. There were multiple incidents where I had to balance a workload of homework, tests, multiple extra curricular, part-time job, and home maintenance simultaneously. Through the premature independent life style I've had for the past five years, I obtained the ability to not only juggle multiple commitments at once but also stay extremely engaged in each.     

Delta Sigma Pi is a well-known fraternity organization throughout the nation. It branches into multiple prestige University institutions and provides beneficial mentorships and opportunities for undergrads that are interested in the business field. Speaking on a personal level, however, DSP became a strong interest to me through the connection of my colleagues at my current position as a DSS IT Service Desk Analyst. 

Alex Bui, Henly Kuang, and Christina Chia (to name a few) really motivated my interest as I see their enthusiasm towards DSP everyday at work. It is incredible to me how I am able to feel the energetic passion from these people even outside of the DSP community, so my only guess for the interior of DSP would be something even more valuable and achieving for me.

Monday: Meet the Chapter

Tuesday: Professional Night





At the time of filling out this bid application form, I have only attended Monday and Tuesday's event but I will be attending all of them. I am just going to say my favorite events would be Wednesday (everyone loves free pizza), but also Thursday for sure because having the Alumni Panel there to have share their experiences with us and being able to talk to them will be very cool.

I would say brotherhood is the unconditional willingness to be there for and improve one another in all aspects of our lives.

I feel that I can contribute a strong desire to improve myself and others around me, as well as collaborative efforts in order to accomplish duties and fulfill aspirations. 

At the moment, my goal to accomplish before I graduate is to have a stronger understanding of what future career path I want to choose, as well as be confident in presenting myself professionally to others.

Despite how much I plan if I were to receive a bid I will likely figure this out during pledging, but my current plan is to be very disciplined in the use of my time and be diligent with my work.

I heard about Delta Sigma Pi ever since my freshman year as one of the two major business professional fraternities on campus, but at the time I never really thought about joining or going out to rush. Also, some of my friends are in Delta Sigma Pi so occasionally I would hear about some things that they were involved in such as events or fundraisers.

Monday: Meet the Chapter



Wednesday: Pizza Night 



I really enjoyed the Meet the Chapter event because I was able to learn more about the fraternity through one-on-one interactions with the brothers. These interactions gave me the opportunity to really get to know everyone and helped me answer some questions about myself that I never bothered trying to asking. I felt that the experience was actually quite enlightening because I now understand what I need to improve on  and feel that I can grow as an individual just as others have grown before me. By having the brothers share their experiences with me, I feel that this fraternity would be the opportunity I need to become a better person.

Although this may be cheesy, I feel that a brotherhood is your home away from home. Though I've graduated from high school, my friends and fellow cadets in JROTC are still a part of me. The experiences and hardships that we went through together helped me improve myself and will always be a part of me. I would like the fraternity to be my next family in this stage of my life. No matter what hardships we may go through, I hope that we will be able to overcome them as an inseparable brotherhood.

I will contribute to the fraternity by utilizing my past experiences as a leader in my high school leadership program to bring new ideas and problem solving skills in order to improve efficiency and minimize problems. By reflecting upon my past errors and successes, I hope to be a beneficial member of the fraternity.

Before I graduate, I hope to form life-long bonds with everyone and to gain leadership experience before I enter the workforce in the future. I would also like to become a more confident individual whose public speaking skills will be on par with everyone else in the fraternity.

I plan to balance my current workload with pledging by efficiently scheduling my day so that no time would be wasted in both studying and pledging. Though pledging will most definitely be a difficult experience, I will properly divide my time so that I won't fall behind in my studies and also have enough time left to commit time to pledging.

I heard about Delta Sigma Pi through Elaine who invited me to the recruitment event page on facebook.

Tuesday: Professional Night

Wednesday: Pizza Night 



I enjoyed Monday: Meet the Chapter the most because I learned about Delta Sigma Pi and I was able to meet the most brothers at this event than all the others. I met Christina, Aimee, David, Isabel, and a few others. We had a lot of quality conversations and I was able to tell them about myself as well as learn about Delta Sigma Pi and the pledging process through them. 

Brotherhood to me means support, respect, and loyalty. Brothers are meant to be supportive and to love to each other no matter what. Brothers lift each other up and encourage each other, not bring them down. Respect is important in brotherhood because it shows there is a sense of admiration in the relationship and that brothers care for each other. Loyalty is key to brotherhood because brothers are meant to be there for each other. 

I will contribute to the fraternity by being a person who is active and supportive of everything the fraternity does. I'm a Do-It-Yourself kind of person. When something needs to be done, I get to it right away. I also enjoy community service so I can plan events and volunteer a lot of my time to any services the fraternity decides to do. I can most certainly bring a positive and ready attitude. My personal motto is to stay positive and confident through everything because that is the first step to success. 

I hope to explore all or most of the aspects of business and find the one that I am most passionate in and start to pursue a career in that by getting internships, speaking publicly, and having part-time jobs.

In order to balance my current workload with pledging I plan to work on my time management skills. I will create a schedule to myself and stick to it unless there are places that are not working out. Then I would take a step back to evaluate my schedule and adjust accordingly. 

I talked to Tiffany and Helena at the Internship and Career Center. Tiffany talked about all the resources in Delta Sigma Pi and how it helped her so I came out to recruitment.

Pizza Night because I got to meet a lot of brothers and interact with them in a more casual setting.

Brotherhood means a person that will always help you even if you are at the lowest point in your life and vice versa.

I can bring curiosity and attention to detail to the Fraternity. Whenever something is incomplete or a question hasn't been asked, I will be sure to bring it up. I also have extensive experience in volunteering and would love to share some of the volunteer ideas that I have.

I hope to build my skills as a potential business leader enough to be able to tackle any job given to me.

I plan to allocate my time accordingly so that I have enough time to do pledging without having my grades suffer. I currently have free time I should be able to plan out my schedule.

Tuesday: Professional Night

Wednesday: Pizza Night 

Thursday: Alumni Panel

My personal favorite was Pizza Night just because everyone had to participate and we were able to get to know all the bros along with those interested in rushing.

Brotherhood is when you're in a bond so tight that you would never lie to one another and you are to go through all obstacles along with each other, assisting when needed but allowing growth wherever is needed. Brotherhood cannot be broken because the people involved should be very dearly to you and it's everlasting. 

I can definitely contribute my leadership and social skills in taking up positions within the fraternity that could help promote growth not only as a whole but with individuals as well. I'm also very into social media and hope to pick up a position that could help market or promote rush events for the fraternity. 

Before transferring to Davis, I knew I wanted to have a GPA of 3.5+ to prepare for an MBA in Finance but I also wanted to be in both a social and professional fraternity. I definitely want more job experiences in terms of internships next quarter and the rest of the quarters here at Davis. I want to grow as an individual both socially and professionally. I plan to achieve these goals in the near future. 

I plan to utilize my time more wisely and if I was to get a bid, I could become an associate for Psi Chi Omega, allowing me to devote more time into DSP. 

I heard about DSP through flyers, Jeanie, my housemate who's in AKPSI, and through Kris who's a Psi Chi little sis.

Tuesday: Professional Night

Wednesday: Pizza Night 

Thursday: Alumni Panel

Professional Night with Brooks Brothers was my favorite event.  As someone who is interested in pursuing my desire and passion for fashion and retail, the speaker really resonated with me.  In addition to being able to hear a speaker from a brand that I so well admire, I was able to learn defining characteristics between Business Casual attire and Business Formal attire and quick tips and tricks for matching shirts with ties and suits.  

A brotherhood is the bonding of individuals of various backgrounds, beliefs, and places around a set of goals and shared commonality.  These goals and commonalities help keep us together when disagreements arise and give us strength in troubling times.  However, the standard dictionary definition of brotherhood glosses over the emotional aspect of it, it is not easily definable or tangible.  There is a bond between brothers that last not just in your college years but also for a lifetime.  A brotherhood could be viewed closely as a friendship as there is an emotional linkage between individuals from shared experience and growth.  The feeling of friendship allows us to freely express our opinions and advocate for issues we are passionate about.  A brotherhood does not bind an individual to one standard viewpoint, but instead seeks to give an opportunity to work with others to come to a consensus over issues.  Brotherhood pushes you to be a better you, especially with Delta Sigma Pi, the discovery of self-awareness comes from challenging yourself rather than remaining stagnant. 

I believe I would be able to contribute compassion and kindness.  Compassion plays a large role in any interaction you have. Empathy and kindness are qualities that are important in not only personal relations, but also business relations.  Showing these qualities mean taking your own personal needs out of the equation and putting your focus and energy on the other person and task on hand.   I can bring a can do attitude and personality, which I believe is important to learning who you are as a person.  Being a hard worker, I am motivated to push myself to try my best and succeed.  I enjoy being challenged, and being a somewhat shy person, seemingly daunting tasks such as meeting with officials pushes me to work on speaking and social skills.

Before graduation, I hope to accomplish the goal of gaining confidence in myself.  I have always been the type to rely on otherâs opinions on me, unable to define myself without the help of my friends.  With the gaining of confidence, I hope to gain self-awareness and be able to recognize by strengths and my weaknesses.  To be able to realize my strengths and weaknesses and work to better and build upon them would benefit my confidence immeasurably.  Besides personal accomplishments, I want to be able to give back to the community with the time I have left.  I believe that giving back to a community that fosters your personal development is important, albeit challenging I believe that even giving back in small ways such as helping a fellow classmate with an assignment or a friend through a tough time counts.   The four pillars of professionalism, finance, community service, and social all work together to create a well-rounded individual, and that is what I hope to be.  

I find myself using my planner and Google calendar to balance my time out well.  I still use the Passion Planner and find that it is extremely helping in showing what times I have free to do homework and other pressing matters that need taking care of.   To balance my current workload with pledging, I would most likely use my planner to identify free time and prioritize tasks from there.  

I was doing research of what groups I could become involved in on campus when I transferred to Davis and Delta Sigma Pi stood out to me.  Looking more into it, I found that Delta Sigma Pi would really help the soft skills and professional skills that I lacked and wanted to build upon such as public speaking, confidence building, and networking skills.

I enjoyed all of the events so far, but I particularly liked Tuesday's Professional Night. I liked learning about putting together a professional wardrobe, and how to best dress professionally in addition to meeting and talking to the brothers. Any opportunity to learn is welcomed.  

Brotherhood is a bond, weak or strong, depending on the degree of commitment and how it is maintained. It is a privilege, and like most valuable relationships very complicated. I don't believe brotherhood automatically means friendship, but friendships can be born from it. To me, brotherhood is growing together, creating bonds and memories, as well as supporting and competing with one another to bring the best out of everyone. 

I can contribute with my organizational skills, and with my ability to work well in a group. I am a fast and eager learner and can learn on the job, and I can motivate the people around me by bringing a positive attitude in what needs to be done

Before I graduate, I hope to make friendships and bonds that will last a lifetime, and have devloped skills and a sense of direction to acheive my future goals. I would also like to leave a mark in the lives of people I meet here in a positive way before I leave.

I plan on blancing my current workload with pledging by prioritizing, organizing my workload and schedule, and setting goals. If I do get a bid, I will place pledging as one of my top priorities and learn on the job to meet expectations

Tuesday: Professional Night





Meet the Chapter because I had the opportunity to talk to seven brothers during that night and I learned a lot about each and every one of them.

Brotherhood to me represents a bond that cannot relate to a normal friendship. A brotherhood lasts for a lifetime and those individuals will always be there when you need them the most.

I can contribute my commitment to this fraternity and hope to do everything I could to see DSP flourish. 

I hope to already have a mindset of what I am going to do when I graduate.

Since I worked 2 jobs and was heavily involved in high school, I had to do a lot of time management in high school. I asked my supervisor to cut my hours in half, won't be going to the gym as much, and planned my Spring quarter to have a less workload.

I told this story to all the brothers I talked to but, to sum it up, I saw Delta Sigma Pi tabling. In addition, my best friend at UC Irvine joined DSP and his experiences helped influence my decision of joining.

Tuesday: Professional Night





I liked Professional Night, because I learned how to dress for any professional occasion as well as talk to brothers from the chapter that I did not get to talk to the first day. I also had a little more time to think about any other questions I wanted to ask. 

To me, brotherhood means family, mutual reliance, and trust. It is a connection in which you can rely on one another no matter what the circumstances are. It also brings people together as a family, where people can trust one another unconditionally and without judgement.

I am a very responsible an organized person. I can take on any challenge and make sure my team members are on the same page. I do not run away from responsibilities but walk through it step by step. I am also open-minded, cooperative and also adaptable. I listen to what others have to say and take everyone's ideas into consideration, though I am not passive. If I were to join the Fraternity, I would be not only a leader but also a team member.

I hope to gain as much experience as possible before I graduate. I currently have my options open to a few fields in business because I have not yet experienced what it is like to work in those fields. I plan to start early and look for internships each summer before I graduate. Hopefully by that time, I will know what field I have the most passion for.

I am currently on a high commitment dance team on campus as well, but I manage my time very efficiently. I know it may become very stressful, but I plan to leave a certain amount of time every week for each activity. I will plan my schedule ahead of time and start as early as possible. I have been using this technique of time management throughout my whole academic career and I have never missed a deadline, so I believe I can work hard to keep up my grades and my position on the dance team while pledging for Delta Sigma Pi.

I did not consider joining a professional business fraternity until I studied abroad last quarter in Shanghai. I met Dylan and many brothers in other chapters, and they told me what Delta Sigma Pi was all about.

My favorite event was the Professional Night with Brooks Brothers. It was amazing to learn a lot about proper fashion so I would be able to use it in the future. It is important to look confident and stylish in all aspects of business and being able to talk to an industry leader like Brooks Brothers and having Mic teach me proper attire was great for me. 

As an only child I was not privy to the ins and outs of having a sibling but I have been blessed with having three friends who I consider to be my brothers. Through our adventures and growing up together for the past 10 years I have learned that brotherhood means you are willing to say the things that need to be said, no matter how hard it is. Brothers not only guide each other but also catch each other when they fall. From my experience, the hardest part of guiding or catching is saying the truth. It may be hard but it is the right thing to do, and brothers are willing to do hard things for each other. 

While I have a lot to learn in the business field, I will bring my work ethic, humor and loyalty to the fraternity. Not only would I be there for all my brothers at their time of need, I would also do my best to help the fraternity, as a whole, succeed and improve in any way I can. If it means I need to lighten the mood or do more "grunt" work I am more than willing to do so. 

I hope to finish my P and FM actuary exams before I graduate so I would be able to continue on my path as an actuary once I join the workforce. 

While I was in community college I was not only a full-time student but I also worked full-time to pay for my education. I will use what I learned for the past two years in the areas of time management, tenacity and mental fortitude to balance my current workload with pledging. 

I heard about Delta Sigma Pi from my friends at NYU, facebook events and current brother Didi Yang.

I liked Professional Night the most because the guest speaker along with his presentation were very interesting and fun at the same time.  Also, the conversations I held with brothers were stimulating and informative.

The mutual trust and friendship shared among a group of people.  In the context of DSP, a community of like-minded, goal-oriented individuals who push each to achieve success and are always there to help one another.

I am a team player.  I will always keep an open mind and listen to the ideas and suggestions of my brothers.  I will always push my brothers to their full potentials.  I will always be there for my brothers and help them.  

I hope to gain invaluable professional skills, establish meaningful friendships, network, and land internships.  

By using my time more efficiently.  Whenever my schedule gets busier, I simply make appropriate lifestyle changes in order to create more time for the activity.  This usually involves cutting down on leisure time. 

By simply googling, "UC Davis Professional Business Fraternity." Also, my friend from the dorms (Mary) vouched for the fraternity.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

The event I liked the best so far was Pizza Night, just because I feel as if I was able to get a better grasp of the atmosphere of Delta Sigma Pi in a more casual setting, as well as getting to know other students attending recruitment. I enjoyed the fact that conversations seemed to be more spontaneous and organic rather than having more of premeditated discussion.

To me, brotherhood is a tight knit group of a people, who accept one another for who they are, what they're interested in, and what they plan to do in the future. I believe a brotherhood provides a very caring and nurturing environment to help foster one another's talents and help each other grow.

I think I will bring a new and fresh perspective to the fraternity, as well as a person who is passionate and committed to the things I put my mind to. I would definitely delve into the fraternity, hoping to take on leadership positions and remain active in as many ways as I can.

Before I graduate, I hope to fully flesh out what I want in the future, both on a professional and personal level. I want to be able to hone in on my skills and take advantage of them, as well as develop any and all skills that may be lacking. Before I graduate I'd also hope to develop friendships and bonds that make leaving Davis a bittersweet experience.

I pride myself in being able to organize my schedule and balance out various things in my life. While I have a 15 unit course load currently, I've been able to manage my time well and finish work early on, as I expect to continue to do during a pledging process. However, I would make sure to prioritize pledging the same way I would prioritize my grades (rather than letting it fall to second).

I was introduced to Delta Sigma Pi by a friend in the chapter at UCSD.

I enjoyed pizza night. I felt like the time was effectively spent in familiarizing such a large group of people, and it was enjoyable to get to know the chapter in a more personal light. And free pizza is always great. 


Brotherhood is about being bigger than yourself. Itâs about being part of a family-- when youâre on a team, you win together, and you lose together. Itâs more of a feeling--a sense of camaraderie--than a palpable goal. Itâs also about good intentions. It explains how you can be delighted by anotherâs achievements, and how you find yourself always willing to help. Brotherhood is pride. Itâs about being so content with the community that youâve surrounded yourself with that youâre excited to share it with the rest of the world. 
Brotherhoodâs a drop of water in a bucket. Itâs a singular entity that creates ripples that far exceed the size of its origin. 


I believe that I can bring passion and creativity. My natural enthusiasm for learning often engages me in conversation to inquire and discuss ideas. Itâs passion that can unite individuals and amounts to dedication and focus. My artistic background in music and art has taught me how to think outside the box. It helps me foster growth and see distinct solutions that could benefit myself and my peers. 

I hope to develop my professional background that secures my aspirations as an consultant and business lawyer, cultivate security and confidence in my personal growth, and gain an inspiring community to create memories that last a lifetime.

Itâs important to prioritize whatâs important when it comes to a heavy workload. While I anticipate having less free time, pledging for Delta Sigma Pi will be a worthwhile experience to set aside time for. I also understand that I would have the support of my pledge brothers to lean on and to encourage throughout the whole process-- the realization that I would not be pledging alone would help keep me focused. 

I've heard about DSP from a few brothers on campus and am familiar with chapters from other schools.

Monday: Meet the Chapter



Wednesday: Pizza Night 



Meet the Chapter, because it was the event that got me wanting to attend them all. Though I wasn't able to due to scheduling conflicts, I really loved how the brothers approached me instead of the other way around. It made me feel like they genuinely wanted to get to know me.

Brotherhood means to me a union of different backgrounds and upbringings bonded together by the same goal. Also while being able to face through the challenges and celebrating the victories.

I will contribute my uplifting spirit to my prospective brothers as a positive outlook for when times are rough. 

I hope to accomplish pushing personal boundaries for myself and have a clearer understanding of who I am as a person as a result.

As a transfer student, I am used to having a routine-based lifestyle. I've managed to balance school, work, and my personal life all while pursuing my enrollment into a 4-year university.

I learned about Delta Sigma Pi through my friends back at home. A handful of them are in DSP and encouraged me to check out Davis' chapter.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I liked Thursdayâs event (Alumni Panel) the most, because it was an eye-opening experience into the impact the Delta Sigma Pi experience has on students now and for the rest of their careers. Although aware of the fraternityâs basic tenets, I had not realized how unique of an experience it would be to join the Delta Sigma Pi brotherhood, and the longevity of its effects. My conversations with brothers in the chapter proved how valuable Delta Sigma Piâs resources are to determined undergraduate business students, but it was striking how the alumniâs inspiring anecdotes and personal experiences were attributed to the skills and opportunity they found in the fraternity years ago. The first few events inspired me to learn more about the organization and the prospect of joining such a prestigious and unique community, but the alumni panel proved the value of brotherhood now and for years to come.

To me, brotherhood is a mutual understanding of commitment, compassion, and transparency with one another that can only be forged by shared experiences, whether they are great challenges or superior accomplishments. Brotherhood is making yourself available to your fellow brothers in any way possible, whether that is providing constructive criticism to challenge a brother to be their best, or being by avaliable to listen and contribute in the face of daunting tasks. It is recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of one another to improve the fraternity as a whole, and building relationships that will last a lifetime.

I plan to contribute my passion for working towards quality results, which is driven by my strong work ethic, ability to understand people and leverage their strengths, and optimism in the face of adversity. I plan to bring energy and enthusiasm to all aspects of the fraternity, and a dedication to the betterment of myself and my brothers in upholding Delta Sigma Piâs high standards.

 Before I graduate, I hope to find my passion within the business world. This will require seeking opportunities and taking advantage of all available resources to gain a better understanding of the various areas in business, as well as a multidisciplinary mastery of the subject matter in the Managerial Economics major. I hope to master the qualities of a capable businesswoman through internships, networking with peers and by capitalizing on all business-related opportunities so I feel confident and prepared to enter the working world upon graduation.

I plan to balance my current workload with pledging by prioritizing my tasks by ensuring I am organized, focused, and goal-oriented as to produce quality work for all of my commitments. This includes keeping detailed lists and current calendars of both my academic and Delta Sigma Pi responsibilities. This way, I will always have a visual of my daily deliverables, what is coming up next, and what I can frontload for the near future. 

I heard about Delta Sigma Pi through friends at other universities, Facebook, and Professor Lundbladâs ARE 112 class.

Wednesday: Pizza Night 

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I enjoyed the alumni night the most because it was inspiring to see the lasting brotherhood of Delta Sigma Pi. I was amazed at how alumni from decades before were still connected with the fraternity and were eager to speak about their experiences. Some flew out from other states just to speak and share their knowledge. Although I expected the alumni to value the professional development of Delta Sigma Pi the most, it turned out that the personal relationships they built were most important to them. Overall, alumni night confirmed that Delta Sigma Pi was something I want to be a part of. 

To me, brotherhood is an unbreakable bond of friendship, support, and understanding between a group of people. People in a brotherhood can go to each other for support in times of stress, but can also hang out with each other and have fun. During high school, I played basketball for all four years. After graduating, I realized that the best part about basketball wasnât the game-winning shots or the rim-shattering dunks. It was the team camaraderie built through hours of practices and long bus rides. As a result, I was close with every single player on my varsity teams. I could joke around with them one day and give advice on serious issues the next. High school basketball allowed me to experience brotherhood, turning basketball into one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. After participating in recruiting week, I can say that Delta Sigma Pi can provide the same type of experience.

I will contribute by being diligent and giving my best effort on all projects and presentations. If given a bid, I will use my organizational skills to work efficiently with the pledge class to complete assignments. In addition to these skills and traits, I will bring a positive attitude and a willingness to learn and improve. I am also team oriented, and willing to sacrifice for the team in order for something to be accomplished.


Before graduating, I want to make sure I fulfill my college experience by joining organizations and meeting new people. I want to leave college with no regrets by exploring new things. Professionally, I hope to discover what field of business I want to pursue through internship experience and hopefully the Delta Sigma Pi brotherhood. However, professional development is not the only goal I have in mind. I also plan to make new friends with similar career goals and interests to hang out with or talk to for advice and guidance. These friends will be people who I can talk to years down the road. Lastly, I want to find my true passion in life before setting out for the real world. Currently, I feel that that passion is somewhere in the business field.

During my four years of high school, I have developed excellent time management and concentration. In addition to taking AP classes, I participated in numerous extracurricular activities including basketball, school newspaper, and Boy Scouts. When I got to UC Davis it was relatively easy to adjust to the college workload. I usually strategically plan out my week in advance to balance out work, classes, and extracurricular activities. Regardless, I know that the pledging process will be difficult, but I am up for the challenge. In order to balance out my current workload with pledging, I will use my free time to prepare for projects and presentations usually days before the due date. I am willing to sacrifice this free time to ensure the best work of my capabilities. 

I first heard about Delta Sigma Pi from one of my best friends from high school who pledged in Fall 2015 at UC Santa Barbara. After switching my major to Managerial Economics, I also talked to a friend who is in Alpha Kappa Psi in Davis about where to meet new people with similar career goals and interests in business. She mentioned that there were two co-ed business fraternities, one being Alpha Kappa Psi and Delta Sigma Pi. After hearing that Alpha Kappa Psi was more broad and accepted all majors, I decided to check out Delta Sigma Pi, which was more business-oriented.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I enjoyed the Alumni Panel the most out of the four events simply because of the diversity presented to us in those six individuals. Coming from such a broad variety of careers, each alumnus gave terrific advice towards the entire pledging process as well as hilarious recollections of their years as a member of DSP. Coupled with their undeniable chemistry together and terrific moderation, I couldn't help but feel both confidence and appreciation towards both the process of becoming a member of DSP and the experience of actually being a member when the closing moments of the panel came. I'll leave that event with the quotation from Vik/Sean forever in my mind, that "luck is a when opportunity meets preparation."

Brotherhood to me implies more than just the notion of being close to a specific group of people. Brotherhood entails sacrifice, compromise, and appreciation towards those whom you have built such a bond with. Being a brother to another means that you'll make time for their time of need, give critique when needed, and value the moments of accomplishment that you two share. Sacrifice is inherent to something as basic as brotherhood, as sometimes your own momentary well-being or success can take second place to another's. In turn, such a sacrifice will be made for you.

Brotherhood is the product of a bond forged through both the triumphs and the defeats between a group of individuals, as well as every conceivable event in between, where individuals give and take their respective shares from a pool filled by the hard work and contributions by its members.

I aim to give the Fraternity all my skills learned if ever required, be it in writing a document in Microsoft Word or filling out sheets in Excel. Beyond sheer capability of talents learned in a computer class, I wish to contribute both my developing skills as leader and my ability to work diligently and effectively on a project with a definitive deadline. I am completely capable of managing various parts of a project, and insuring that the end product is more than just a sum of its parts. If necessary, I can also provide a constructive critique of my peers with honesty, understanding the possible backlash I could receive.

I am ready to make sacrifices for the sake of this Fraternity, for Delta Sigma Pi; to give my hand towards a brother in need or give my skills or my advice to anybody who would require them. I want to be a person who others can rely on to deliver an effective product or useful advice, to anybody who would require it. In return, I would love to be given the opportunity to grow and learn as both a professional and simply as a human being, as I can understand that this type of brotherhood transcends beyond business or family, as it is an impressive combination of both.

I want to hone the skills that I may already possess, and develop the ones that I may be lacking, and in the end, contribute anything possible to better the state of Delta Sigma Pi at UC Davis, and nation-wide if possible, be it through personally aiding in the Fraternity's projects or simply being there for its brothers.

Before graduation, I would love to have a job ready for me in some faucet of business that I am not too sure about as of now. With so many different opportunities, be it in consulting, management, accounting, and various other categories, I cannot even begin to fathom where to begin with internships and experience before finally making some semblance of a final decision.

I intend to graduate with the University Honors Program and the Regents Scholarship recognition, maintaining around a 3.7 GPA or above in all of my classes. I truly intend on completing at least two internships before my Senior year at Davis, in some fields related to business, and I would also love to accomplish being a pledge at Delta Sigma Pi while I'm at it.


I currently plan on allotting around 4 to 5 hours a day for pledge-related activities, and more if needed on weekends in order to meet any requirements or deadlines. With a majority of my homework being online, I could also physically skip some lectures and make up material learned at a later time if my help is greatly needed or work must desperately be done. My current time spent on homework per week borders around 3 hours, so the pledging process would not make the work in any of my classes unbearably difficult by any means, easily giving me time to study for exams and get additional aid for my classes if need be.

I heard about Delta Sigma Pi originally from one of my floormates clicking interested on the Facebook recruitment page. That piqued a bit of interest in me, so I asked him a couple questions about the event, like who he knew, or why he was going. The idea of joining a Business Fraternity or any Fraternity by that manner had never really occurred to me, but the emphasis on professionalism shown to me by a google search of the Nu Rho chapter (excellent website, by the way) had created an incentive to at least check out the first day. From there, I could tell Delta Sigma Pi was an organization worth putting the effort into and joining.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I really enjoyed the fourth event âAlumni Panelâ the most because it solidified any questions or concern I had for Delta Sigma Pi. Hearing all these alumni speak about their experiences reinforced everything that I heard from all the brothers. Along with all that it showed the connections they all hold with each other after graduating and giving back what they learned to the community. It showed that all their experiences through Delta Sigma Pi really helped them with landing and performing at their current jobs. Hearing the alumni speak showed how well Delta Sigma Pi helped the brothers forge a unbreakable bond and prepare them for the real world. 

Brotherhood means a group of people who are goal-oriented individuals and have each otherâs back regardless of the situation. This group is always there for each and every individual in that group. The people in the brotherhood bring out the best in each other helping each person reach their potential that they did not realize they had at first.

I can contribute my previous overseas internship experience at a Multi-Family Office. Also I can show the difficulties of transitioning from living in the US to living in a whole new country alone. I am a funny, hard-working, easygoing person eager to help people when they need it. Also I am a good listener and will give advice to those based on my past experiences but I know when to stay silent. The main thing I bring to the table is my motivation. If I set a goal, I put my 110% effort into reaching that goal.

I hope to accomplish a direction in which I want to start my career in. After my internship in Beijing, I realized the field I worked in was mainly for experienced older people who have worked for a good amount of time.  I know that the business field branches off into many sectors and I am pretty unsure about what my passion is and what I want to do in the future. My goal is to gain a sense of what I want to do in the future and grow from that and I feel Delta Sigma Pi can help me a lot with that.

I hear from many people that pledging is a very intense and difficult experience. However I think I am up for that challenge. Personally for me, the more free time I have the more I tend to slack off. Vice versa, when I am extremely busy I tend to focus better and study harder in that time. Throughout college I realized that when I âstudyâ I would have my computer or phone next to me and I would check it often while studying. With pledging I think I would work a lot harder but I would focus a lot harder during the time I actually have to study.

The first time I heard of Delta Sigma Pi was at the BCNC student networking night. The funny part is I went to that event to check out Alpha Kappa Psi because I actually did not hear about Delta Sigma Pi yet. However I met Tyler and Jin at the event during one of the group swaps and they introduced themselves and gave a background of Delta Sigma Pi.  After talking to them, I felt that Delta Sigma Pi was the right fit for me.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I personally liked Thursday's Alumni Panel the best. After a long week of classes, projects, and midterms, it was a refreshing way to end Thursday night being able to listen firsthand to fellow Delta Sigma Pi alumni who gained so much from their experience in the fraternity. Laughing along to their stories but still resonating and taking in their tips was both enjoyable and beneficial. With alumni ranging from 2001 graduates to alumni who just got their degree two months ago, it was surreal to see what Delta Sigma Pi has done for them and the connections they still maintain with their brothers. Speaking with alumni members afterwards also gave a personable touch, chatting with them about the mistakes they've made, the knowledge they've gained, and the goals they have yet to achieve.

Also, since I met many brothers during the first three nights, it was fun to be able to be more comfortable with them after seeing and chatting with them a few times. Seeing and listening to the alumni panel's advice and personal stories put it all into perspective that that could possibly be me sitting in front of a group of future Delta Sigma Pi brothers who are also hoping to gain a worthwhile experience joining the fraternity. 

Brotherhood is knowing you have a support system behind you, no matter what obstacles or tribulations occur or come your way. It's accepting one another for who they are, and embracing them wholeheartedly as an equal yet being open to learn from their experiences and personal beliefs. Brotherhood is seeking and offering a helping hand, and understanding that there may be disagreements and differences in opinion but also being willing to listen and move forward as a unit. It's laughing at inside jokes and clumsy mishaps while knowing advice and your support system is a text, call, or Facebook message away. Brotherhood is a life-long relationship to not be taken for granted but rather embraced and cherished. 

Attending each event I can clearly see the strong brotherhood between the brothers of Delta Sigma Pi. Despite Delta Sigma Pi being a professional fraternity, there is still a prevalent personal bond between the brothers that is admirable to someone like myself who hasn't personally had that brotherhood before. 


With technical skills in graphic and informational design, I can contribute to the marketing and overall branding of Delta Sigma Pi and its events. I have experience in video editing and teaching youth about principles in business, marketing, coding, and entrepreneurship. However, despite the concrete experience and skills I have, the most important aspect I can bring to the table is my willingness to grow and progress professionally and personally. 

I am always open to learning more, and I truly believe no matter how old, wise, rich, or "successful" one gets, there's always room to learn and self improve. I am willing to take the "dirty jobs" no one else wants to do in order to contribute a lending hand and also learn a few things along the way. I may not have a history of highly reputable internships or have studied  business worldwide, but I can offer my genuine desire to grow, connect with other motivated individuals, and overall become a better, multifaceted person. I truly believe you are who you surround yourself with, and if I continue striving to inspire and also being inspired, the sky is the limit for what I and Delta Sigma Pi could achieve. 


Before I'd graduate I want gain enough confidence where I can go out into the "real world" and present myself as a strong job candidate and overall a genuinely good person. Coming to college, I reverted from the active, high school social butterfly to a timid, lost freshman. I struggled to find other motivated individuals who I could connect with and become the life long friends everyone promised you'd find in college. 

But Jin said something in her speech on Monday recruitment night that resonated with me and surely others- you are responsible for yourself. I am responsible for myself and my future. I couldn't keep being scared and intimidated of uncertainty and I had to put myself out there in order to have others reciprocate as well. Yes, I would love a reputable internship or job as any business-minded person would, but first and foremost I want to be able to be completely comfortable in my own skin in order to present myself professionally and love myself personally. As a second year student it is still a work in progress, but witnessing myself open up to others and subject myself to possible criticism is a testimony for where I've come and where I want to go. 


It will definitely be a challenge balancing both schoolwork and Delta Sigma Pi, but when I want something bad enough, I will make it work. I do not commit myself to anything I know I can't put 110% in, and that accounts for school, personal relationships, and any extracurricular activities. Talking to brothers this week gave me an overall consensus of the incoming stress and hectic schedule of pledging, however I resonated with a few who anecdotally told me that once you're forced to be on top of your priorities, you learn how to manage your time well and everything will fall into place. I personally thrive off of productivity and the rush I feel knowing I'm accomplishing my goals. I'm someone who wants to excel in everything I do, and I don't make commitments if I know I can't put in the time and dedication necessary to succeed. I came to recruitment knowing that this is what I wanted and I would not take that for granted.

My friend Andrew, who has also been to recruitment this week, told me about Delta Sigma Pi roughly last summer or late into my freshman year. Hearing Greek words immediately scared me off as I had preconceived notions about Greek life contributed to how it's depicted in the media. However, he reassured me that Delta Sigma Pi was a reputable professional business fraternity which then sparked my interest. I recalled that I had family members in different chapters of Delta Sigma Pi, and they were now successful businesswomen who I admire. 

I did my research and became excited about the opportunities available- a large, diverse network of alumni, workshops and events dedicated to professional and personal improvement, and a brotherhood bond I never had. Although I was interested and impressed with Delta Sigma Pi's accomplishments and history, I was hesitant to throw myself into an unfamiliar environment, similar to my initial introversion moving to a small college town from a big Bay Area city. I passed off the fall recruitment due to pure anxiety but my prevailing interest of Delta Sigma Pi and desire to grow led me to recruitment this week, and I am glad I came because talking to brothers and learning about their own experiences and personalities makes me excited for what's to come.

I liked Professional Night the best. Being a Textiles and Clothing major, I was fascinated by everything District Manager of Brooks Brothers, Mic Clark, presented to us. I was hooked the moment he started talking about the history of Brooks Brothers'. The presentation generally changed my perspective on workplace fashion. You can dress professionally and personally. I was sad that I did not get the opportunity to talk to him and ask him about his experience in the retail industry. 

I truly believe brotherhood is something that has to be experienced over time to fully comprehend what it is. But for now, I believe brotherhood is a bond that will always be remembered and never broken. Brotherhood is something you can go to no matter what the situation is. I believe a brotherhood at UC Davis can be considered as a home away from home.


Being a Textiles and Clothing major, I can contribute by adding diversity to the majors in the Fraternity and exposing the brothers to the different aspects of Textiles and Clothing. I hope to open doors and encourage other Textiles and Clothing majors to join Delta Sigma Pi.
I can bring creativity to the table. I currently run a personal/lifestyle blog that features my own photography. From my site, I have gain creativity, confidence, and coordination from web designing, photographing, and interacting with my followers. I constantly have to post new content to my blog and pay attention to every single detail that is featured in my photos because it is seen by thousands of my followers.


Before I graduate, I hope to land an internship at a major retail company such as Nordstrom or Gap. Before I can land these internships, I must develop my soft skills. Personally before I graduate, I hope to improve in interviewing and public speaking skills, skills that will allow me to thrive in the retail industry and prepare for the real/business world.

When I am overwhelmed with a lot of work, I take a second and make a list of the things I have to do. I begin to prioritize the things on the list. Because I need in good academic standing to be and stay in Delta Sigma Pi, I will prioritize school first. Because I made the choice to pledge, I must also put it as one of my top prioritizes. Social sacrifices will be made if needed. 

I wanted to join an organization that will help me develop my professional skills. My cousin, a former UC Davis but not a member, suggested me to join a professional fraternity.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

All the events were wonderful, however, I enjoyed the alumni panel the most. Being able to hear the success of past brothers from Delta Sigma Pi definitely highlights all the opportunities I can receive from Delta Sigma Pi. It was especially enjoyable to hear how they cherish the relationships from Delta Sigma Pi the most as well. It definitely shows that Delta Sigma Pi provides lifelong friendships. 

Brotherhood means everything to me. I believe I am an individual who's inspired and influenced by those around me. Being around 40 highly successful and motivated brothers will definitely help myself develop even further - both professionally and individually. Davis encompasses over 30,000 students, and Delta Sigma Pi gathers around 40 students with similar interests and personalities. I believe this helps form many important and lovable relationships. It truly becomes a brotherhood. 

I believe my experience with golf has definitely made me different from other students. Golf has not only taught me how to overcome adversity, but also how to compete under pressure. I've had to work as a leader in a struggling golf team and motivate every member to become better. I've been in slumps that led me to the point of quitting but prevailed. I've had the experience of performing and competing with sponsors and college coaches watching me. Because of my experience with golf, I believe I offer a unique asset towards the fraternity. I believe it has taught me many life skills and a positive mentality that can't be learned elsewhere. 

Before I graduate I hope to form many connections and important friendships. I hope I develop the professionalism and soft skills needed to succeed in any career. Most importantly, I hope to discover myself and my interests. 

Throughout my entire education, I've always been a student-athlete. Even in my college education, I have maintained good grades and golf. I believe that playing golf in high school has helped prepare me for a heavy workload. Attending school 7 hours a day for 5 days a week and traveling to various states and practicing golf for 40 hours week has really taught me how to manage my time well. I've learned that organizing and planning out my events really help me complete the most work in the least amount of time. Because of this, I believe I will be able to balance out my current workload with pledging.

I have always had a business fraternity in my mind while entering college. During my fall quarter I met David and Mary who extolled the virtues of Delta Sigma Pi. My brother, being in the Rho Chapter at UC Berkeley, also described to me the many benefits of joining Delta Sigma Pi.

Wednesday: Pizza Night 

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I enjoyed the pizza night because it gave me a chance to see a more casual side of the brothers. It was personally easier for me to connect with the brothers in the more relaxed environment.

Brotherhood has many implications. To be a brother means to always be there, no matter what the situation is. Sacrifice is required with true brotherhood. This means being willing to criticize your brother or push them out of the comfort zone even if they don't like it. It's being honest with them even if the truth hurts. Most of all, it's unconditional love. A brother loves a brother, regardless of what may happen between them.

I think I add a new dimension to the fraternity. I'm focused more on entrepreneurship rather than working in a more corporate environment. I've worked in some early stage startups, so I have some experience in business at a companies' earliest stages. 

Besides this, I also think I would make a great brother. I am not afraid to push my brothers, or call them out on them when they're doing something I don't think is beneficial to them. I also have a decent network that I can connect the rest of the fraternity with as opportunities arise.

Before I graduate, I hope to be apart of a startup that makes it past a seed round. I also want to build up the entrepreneurship community at UC Davis, perhaps through starting a club or other means.

I will be taking twelve units, so I should have plenty of time to pledge. I've also learned to work efficiently and effectively in high pressures situations from experiences in the past. 

I heard about Delta Sigma Pi through my roommate Andrew Le.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

Although I enjoyed every single event put on by the brothers of Delta Sigma Pi, I found the Alumni Panel to be the most eye-opening and motivating event. 

Hearing the alumni speak about their journey to get to where they are today and how Delta Sigma Pi has helped them has allowed me to gain a better picture of what the fraternity is all about. 

As the alumni has said, it is through the professionalism and brotherhood of Delta Sigma Pi that they were able to have valuable experiences that have helped propel them into their current positions. It has made me more hopeful of what I can expect through Delta Sigma Pi. 

I resonated with Naeem when he gave his piece of advice about not being so afraid and to take more risks. It is something that has definitely been something that Iâve thought about for a while, and to hear a successful alumni also say that means that it is important. 

Like nearly everyone else my age, I am also concerned about my future and often wonder if I have what it takes to be successful in the real world. But hearing Naeem speak about how he too used to be afraid and how he has overcome that has given me more motivation to continue my own journey. 

I enjoyed what all of the alumni had to say and walked out much more inspired and motivated. I felt as though all the events this week has led up to the alumni panel and was a great way to wrap up recruitment week. 


Brotherhood means a group of people who are all bounded by a common goal  and all share a deep connection and in this case it is Delta Sigma Pi. They all have a profound and very rooted relationship that extend to the point of kinship. It is a friendship that lasts for a lifetime and can transcend what it means to really be a friend. Brotherhood means you are basically blood related brothers and you will go out of your way to do things that most people usually wouldnât do.

I hope that I can bring my success and goal oriented mindset to the fraternity. I am very driven and motivated to succeed and work hard in situations that I am put in. I want to use the skills that I have and apply them to roles that are needed within the fraternity. 

I have many years of experience with the Adobe Creative Suite and would love to use those skills in a role that the fraternity sees most suitable. I am also an avid portrait and cityscape photographer and believe that could be useful when it comes to photographing fraternity events or outings. 

I hope to accomplish many things before I graduate and what of that is to know that I made college a worthwhile experience. I want to graduate knowing that I was able to grow more as an individual. I want to get out of my comfort zone, meet new people, learn new things and continue to develop into a better person. 

Personal along with professional goals I hope to accomplish include launching my own website showcasing my work. I hope to continue working on my portfolio and eventually code my own website and have it up and running before I graduate. Also, I hope to land an internship at a company that relates to the field I am interested in working in. I wish to learn valuable things during the internship and better develop myself professionally. 

I am a very organized individual and I currently have a master schedule of all the readings, assignments, exams from all my classes printed out. This allows me an easy acess to see what I need to get done ahead of time or how I should prepare myself for the week to make sure I fulfill my tasks. 

As someone with great time management skills, I will know how to make full use of my time to complete my school work and pledge responsibilities. 

I plan on getting my school work done ahead of time to allow myself time to complete the responsibilities expected of me as I pledge. 


My first time hearing about Delta Sigma Pi was from a friend back in high school who recommend that I attend their recruitment week. I did not hear anything else about Delta Sigma Pi until I later befriended a few of the brothers and it was through them that I gained more knowledge and insight about Delta Sigma and what you guys do as a professional fraternity.

Wednesday: Pizza Night 

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I like Alumni Panel the best, because it gave me a chance to learn a lot from alumni who have first handed experiences in the industry.

In my opinion, brotherhood is a two way street, in which people give and take from the fraternity. You help other people to grow and receive help and support from them at the same time.

Being a Stats major, a transfer student, and someone who grew up in a different culture, the first thing I can bring to the table is diversity. I am also analytic, detail-oriented, hard-working, and a team-player, and very willing to offer my skill sets to the DSP. Last but not least, I promise that I would contribute my best effort to DSP through thick and thin, and truly see the fraternity as my second family.

I hope to have an internship, to develop my professional skills and to have a network of professional connections and meaningful friendship.

I categorize what I have to do into different categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, neither important nor urgent and use Google Calendar and a planner to keep track of what I have to do. I also do a lot of works at night, and on Tuesday and Thursday when I don't have day classes.

I heard about DSP from the table at the MU, and also from the event page on Facebook.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

I liked the alumni panel the most because it was very inspiring to hear the success stories of former UC Davis students whose experiences with Delta Sigma Pi helped shape them to be the confident and ambitious individuals they are. Their experiences while in UC Davis, as a brother in Delta Sigma Pi, and in their post-graduate career paths motivated me to work harder to improve myself in order to reach the same heights they have.

Brotherhood represents a lifelong bond between individuals who genuinely care for one another. I personally have a blood brother as well as many other old friends that I consider to be brothers as well. The connection we share is inseparable and during hard times, any of us would gladly go out of our way to help a brother in need. The brotherhood embodied by the members of Delta Sigma Pi is no different. Delta Sigma Pi and its brothers form a close-knit family based off of their mutual interest in the business world and their shared drive to learn and become successful individuals in their career fields. 

As a brother of Delta Sigma Pi, one of my priorities is to improve myself as a professional. In addition, I hope to provide the same opportunities to my fellow brothers. I come from an extensive background of varying organizations ranging from bureaucratic student organizations to relatively flat corporate structures. These experiences have taught me operating procedures, efficient work delegation strategies, and project management skills. These skills would greatly benefit Delta Sigma Pi by assisting in streamlining project or meeting planning to create an efficient process towards completing fraternity projects.

During my time in UC Davis, I hope to find myself as not only an individual, but as a professional. I spend much of my time exploring the endless opportunities and resources provided by UC Davis, searching for subjects or activities that I am passionate about. In addition, I constantly work to build upon my professional abilities in both technical skills such as using Excel as well as soft skills like public speaking and interviewing. My goal is for all of the hard work and unwavering determination I display to culminate in molding me into a well-rounded professional, confident in his abilities to help him succeed in his future career. 

My time in Community College taught me many academic-based skills, but the most valuable skill I learned was project management. In order to stay focused, I volunteered for many different organizations to try and absorb as much information as possible. While very difficult, the experience of balancing multiple commitments taught me how to efficiently organize and balance my workload while putting forth my complete effort. One quality I hold very dear to me is my determination to complete everything I take on. I pride myself on my ability to push myself to finish projects and tasks I take on, so I fully intend to complete Delta Sigma Pi's pledging process to the best of my ability.

I heard about Delta Sigma Pi through many of the brothers who I also have classes with. In addition, I was approached by brothers who were tabling outside the CoHo that spoke about the recruitment drive both in the Fall and in the winter.

I enjoyed the second event, professional night, the most. As a design major with a textiles and apparel minor, I found the Brooks Brother presentation to be the most interesting. I was able to strongly relate the presentation to my current classes at school, when the district manager mentioned certain aspects about Brook Brothersâ method in obtaining the nicest fabric and sourcing their labor locally. I also learned helpful business etiquettes and the important differences in the dress code between business casual and business professional that I was often confused by.

For me, brotherhood is another form of second family. It is a group of individuals that are there to provide support for each other not only within academic aspects or career developments, but also in terms of emotional comfort. Brotherhood involves looking out for each other and helping each other improve as a whole. 

As a design and economic double major, I am capable of bringing both sets of skills to the Fraternity. However, I find my design skill to be my strongest contribution to the Delta Sigma Pi. One of the positive aspects of being a design major is my ability to think creatively. I feel that creativity is one thing that all businesses need in order to strive within society. In terms of technical aspects though, I am able to bring my adept skills in using Adobe softwares, eye in branding, and skills in marketing and advertising to further expand the fraternity.

One of my weaknesses is being able to speak my mind and ideas to a large group of people. Therefore, one of my goals is to develop a stronger confidence in myself, and improve in public speaking. I also hope to become a source of motivation for others as I continue to improve myself. I feel that improving yourself is an achievement, but giving back to the community in some form, is an even bigger accomplishment. 

I plan on creating a schedule for myself so that I can divide up my workload evenly throughout the week. Iâve also had prior experience managing a job that required twenty hours of work as an independent contractor conducting data analysis and market researching. However, now that I have quit that job, I am more capable of balancing just between schoolwork and pledging. 

I first head about Delta Sigma Pi from my freshmen year roommate, whom went out to Delta Sigma Piâs Spring 2015 recruitment drive. Iâm also interested in joining a business organization to improve myself professionally, and happen to read more about it online.

Monday: Meet the Chapter

Tuesday: Professional Night

Wednesday: Pizza Night 



     Pizza night showcased a side of the chapter that I had failed to consider, ruling Wednesday the most memorable night of my week. On Monday and Tuesday, I saw Delta Sigma Pi for only part of what it was: an group of hardworking, business-minded young adults. But Pizza night reminded me that the chapter is not just filled with successful figures, but successful people. I noticed the energetic dynamic present between members of the chapter, and how close they appeared to be. In a large public university, that sense of community is both elusive and inspiring, and I yearn to experience it. 


     Brotherhood implies a sense of community dependent on respect, support, and trust. 
     In high school, I came to understand brotherhood as I have just defined it. By working long hours every day of the week with a small group of students in an academic competition, I caught a sense of the term. We spent six to seven days of the week together, up to twelve hours a day. We pushed each other to earn higher scores on tests, develop better interpersonal skills, and grow as human beings. However, what began as a shared thirst for success transformed into deep trust and love. I now look to these people, who began as teammates, as if they were my siblings. I was blessed enough to know their best and worst qualities, memories, and dreams. We pushed each other to new aspirations and levels of success, but understood that we would support each other in times of pain or tribulation. 
     This sense of community--of brotherhood--was painfully missing from my first quarter of college. As I look to the future, I hope to rediscover it among brothers of Delta Sigma Pi. 

     As a freshman still exploring majors and career paths, I understand that I cannot offer many specific skills relating to business. However, I offer support and interpersonal skills. I will do my best to learn and catch up to other brothers, and to support and encourage those who require it. I learn quickly, and will put forth my best effort to learning new skills as rapidly as possible. 
     In short, I offer members of DSP enthusiastic dedication to learning and personal growth, caring support and encouragement, and some (poor) humor along the way. 

     Before I graduate, I hope be leading a life I find meaningful. 
     As a former pre-medical major, I have historically positioned my dreams and goals around the notion of "doing good for others". This semi-altruism is how I have always defined meaning. But lately, my plans have changed--I hope to change academic paths to Managerial Economics. Now, I face the challenge of defining meaning in business. I yearn to pursue a career that benefits society as a whole--a life that I can look back on in future years, and understand that was purposeful. But defining a "meaningful" career in business appears much more difficult than in medicine. As I learn, grow, and face challenges throughout the next four years, I hope to explore the business field and discover a career goal that truly carries significance, on a scale larger than myself. 

     Since my current workload is only 12 units, and I have flexible extra-curricular activities, I would likely face less time-management challenges than other pledges--a lucky fate indeed. However, pledging is treated as a part-time internship and will require a significant time commitment. I may have to sacrifice extra-curricular activities, social life, sleep--or all three--but anything truly important requires sacrifice and dedication. 

     I looked online for economics and business organizations, and a DSP brother mentioned the organization in my Microeconomics lecture.

I liked pizza night the best because the setting was different and as a result everything felt more relaxed and natural. I felt that because of this, I was able to talk to the brothers and get to know them better than some of the other nights. It felt like I was talking to regular people and I was getting to know them. It felt natural and inviting.

Brotherhood means being there for one another. It means that no matter what, there will always be a connection. I feel that brotherhood was coined as a term to refer to a deep connection between people because a relationship between older and younger brother (blood relatives) is very different and can be much more powerful than any other relationship. 

I can't say that I can contribute amazing professional skills or public speaking skills to the Fraternity, but I can say that I will bring to the table a desire to learn and steadfast dedication to do what it takes to succeed. I felt this same drive from the other brothers and from some of the other potential people whom I talked to. I can bring my willingness to try my best and to work as hard as I can to better myself and the fraternity as a whole.

I hope to have a well developed network of contacts, a group of people I can depend on, and to have done something where I can look back on it and know that it was my best work.

Time management is key to succeeding in any field. Pledging and academics will be at the forefront of my priorities.

I heard about it at BCNC's networking night and from Jessica Ngai.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

Alumni Panel. I'm really glad these brothers were about to come out tonight because hearing about their experiences both in and out of Delta Sigma Pi made me want to join this fraternity even more. It was great to hear all the great places they are now employed at but I was more sold on all the great relationships and experiences the brothers were so eager to share with us about.

Brotherhood means loyalty. I think the brothers in Delta Sigma Pi help each other succeed and grow not because doing so will benefit the fraternity with better networks or name recognition, but because they are all looking out for one another. Fueled by loyalty, brothers stick up for one another no matter the circumstances, no matter the losses or benefits.

After talking with many brothers, to be frank, I have nowhere near the amount of work experience and skill sets the brothers have. What I do have, though, is a new-found will to learn. I see myself as someone who could just as easily be a leader as a follower. In this fraternity, I could follow and learn and perhaps later be of guidance to fellow brothers.

I hope to explore different options in life, whether they be social, personal, or professional. College is a time of self discovery, and it is by far more important to learn about yourself than it is about anything you can write on paper.

If I set my mind to do something, then very rarely do I ever actually feel that I do not have enough time to fit things into my schedule. Pledging will be a very important process to me, and I can see myself sleeping 1 hour less, resting 1 hour less, working out 1 hour less, etc. I'll definitely be able to make time.

I've heard about it freshman year from friends and girlfriend's coworkers who were in Delta Sigma Pi. This year, my housemate and close friend has many friends who are brothers in the fraternity and always recommended I come check out the fraternity during recruitment week.

Thursday: Alumni Panel

The Alumni Panel event was the most inspiring event. Hearing what life was like because of Delta Sigma Pi and life after significantly inspired me to be part of the fraternity. Naeem, one of the panel speakers, described how opportunity presents itself in the form of work and luck. Through preparation, he owed a tremendous amount of gratitude to how Delta Sigma Pi shaped his work and the number of opportunities he received because of the fraternity. All of the panelists described a sense of camaraderie and self reflection that I see in the current members. I also want to be part of this community that has such a strong heritage that not only builds one's career but the lifelong relationships within the brotherhood.

Brotherhood most closely resembles with accountability. When I discussed the experiences every member had within Delta Sigma Pi, they all talked about the highs and lows, the triumphs and struggles, or the laughters and moments within Delta Sigma Pi. I believe accountability is not only a way track another person's activities but a close friendship that is resilient. Brotherhood stands against the tests of time, personal struggles, or conflicts and works to solve those issues to become stronger and reveal more about each person. 

I believe I am an approachable person who is not afraid to share my experiences. Whether it be sharing a meal, telling my story, or getting to know my brother, I know what it means to participate in this fraternity. 
I also have a strong background in photography and videography and would also market Delta Sigma Pi and each of its members in such a unique and strong way that would help communicate the mission of Delta Sigma Pi. Through my experience as a designer, I hope to add my skills as an artist to build a higher level of professionalism.

I hope to challenge myself to be a better person. This year, I have gone through a significant amount of change. From eating healthy, exercising on a daily basis, working as a freelance photographer, and even coming out to the Delta Sigma Pi events, I want to simply be more proactive with my life.
Whether it be my overall well-being to my career, being proactive in every aspect of my life is something I hope to accomplish and Delta Sigma Pi would greatly push me in the right direction. 

For eleven years of my life, I have been a classical musician. Performing for many honor groups, community orchestras, professional ensembles and even the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra, I believe I can apply the same skills I have learned as a musician to pledging for Delta Sigma Pi. Promptness and preparation are key factors in one's success within the music world. For eleven years I have understood to never be late, never miss a rehearsal, and perform music at the highest caliber. The same concept applies to pledging as I juggle between school work and recruitment. Participating in so many ensembles has made me diligent in every aspect of my life throughout middle school, high school, and college.

I have class with Mary Serafin and she recommended that I join Delta Sigma Pi. My first interaction with her was very unique; her whole demeanor and driven personality made me curious about what inspires her. I believe Delta Sigma Pi contributed to where Mary is right now.
