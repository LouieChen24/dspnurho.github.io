I am hoping to build a connection with fellow peers that will last a lifetime and to also take the next step into finding a career.

I'm assuming that the pledging process may take a lot of time so I was wondering when will the pledging process begin? If you can answer this question then this will be helpful so I can request my supervisor for less hours during those times. 

I will tell all of you all about me if I see you guys.

I've heard good things from friends at different schools that have an interest in the business field in the future. I'm interested in getting into the business field but still don't have the foot in the door I hope to get from joining DSP. I also hope to find a community of people that have similar interests and drives that I do. 

I'm curious about the alumni network and professional opportunities that come with being a part of the fraternity, as well as how pledging works.

It's been difficult for me to select a future goal - as throughout high school I never really had an idea of what I wanted to do. In senior year of high school I began a blog/Instagram account on fashion. As it continued to gain traction, it became more than a hobby, as I began to network with other bloggers and work with companies through advertising and marketing on social media, even running social media accounts for other companies. From this experience, I found what I am truly passionate about and hope to take the experience I gained to apply in a future career.

I am interested in Delta Sigma Pi's Recruitment Drive because of the multitude of professional resources and networking that the fraternity has access to. I also feel that I will be able to learn a lot about professionalism and myself in order to take greater initiative towards my future career plans.

Are there professional opportunities and resources available for Computer Science majors?
How is the alumni network of Delta Sigma Pi in regards to software development and software engineering companies?

My future career goal lies somewhere in the field of software development, although I am not particularly sure which areas I want to get into (front end, back end, QA, etc. not too sure yet). I have a strong passion for meeting new people and working towards a life that I really want to live. I am inspired by and like to surround myself with driven, hard-working peers and individuals who are not afraid or unwilling to put in the effort in order to work towards what they want in life.

I want to meet a group of people who have the same passion and drive as me to succeed in the future. I talked to a few brothers in Delta Sigma Pi during BCNC's student networking night and they made me feel DSP would be a really good choice for me. The people I met were very caring but also very goal oriented which is very important to me. I hope to meet more of the brothers and others during the recruitment drive and get to know them a lot better.

-How difficult is it balance pledging and school work?
-What opportunities does Delta Sigma Pi provide that Alpha Kappa Psi does not?
-What are the key differences between the two frats?
-Does the Delta Sigma Pi chapter at Davis ever network or interact with other chapters at different schools?


I'm currently exploring what I really want as a job in the future. But recently I did an VC/ PE internship in Beijing for a multi-family office. It was very eye opening and taught me a good amount of skills that otherwise I would not have learned in a classroom setting. I attended a startup accelerator convention called Y Combinator and met a lot CEO's of interesting startups through the Beijing internship. I really want to explore more and see what I want to do in the future and I feel Delta Sigma Pi could help me with that a lot.

I would love to join the Delta Sigma Pi Fraternity. I have a keen interest in business, networking, and professionalism. I believe a large part of business and life is developing connections, and I believe being recruited by Delta Sigma Pi will help me develop the necessary connections toward success. I also hope to develop many lifelong friends and brothers through Delta Sigma Pi. 

I would like to know more about the pledging process, and I would also like to know more about how Delta Sigma Pi provides better professional opportunities.

I am on the Men's golf team here at UC Davis, so I do have other possible time commitments. Aside from aspiring to be a professional golfer, I have always wanted to explore the finance world. I have developed interests of becoming a financial advisor, investment banking, and, mostly, entrepreneurship. I also have an interest and may possibly minor in computer science.

Moreover, I wanna get to know more about Delta Sigma Pi. I come from a business family so my business skills push me to join this fraternity so that I can prepare myself well enough to compete in the professional world.

No questions as of now. 

I'm a very ambitious person. I have many dreams that I wish to fulfil. I believe, delta sigma pi will also help me reach there.  I'm interested in finance and aspire to become an investment banker. I guess, I think about future too much but it's good in a way! During my free time, I love hanging out with friends and I love meeting new people.

I'm a design major, but in high school I specifically took courses in marketing. I would love to have a blend of user experience design and project management somewhere in my future. My minors are my outlets and interests. Dramatic Arts have showed me how to never act afraid and how to improv my way through any situation and education has allowed me to connect with students and faculty in a way I never thought possible. My dream is to work for a company that creates educational products for children, but I'm open to almost any company that fits my needs as well as me fitting theirs.

Delta Sigma Pi provides a way to learn more about business, acquire real-world skills (resume building, interview skills, etc.) and create a smaller community within the larger UC Davis population. 

-   Does Delta Sigma Pi help students to find internships? Is preference given to older students first?
-   What is the pledging experience like?
-   How large is the time commitment?

     Like most students at UC Davis, I'm currently trying to find my place in campus, and in the larger world. I entered the university as an Art History major intending to pursue pre-medical studies, at the urging of my parents and family. But then, something changed. I dropped pre-med, and chose to pursue my true passion--Economics. I fell in love with the business world. The ability of economists and business people to logically analyze patterns and data in order to innovate, create companies, and even improve life amazes me. Business and economics, to me, are more than career paths--they're tools to improving life and engendering change globally. 
    But, I'm not just a hopeful ManEcon major. (I'm an actual person too, I promise!) I love photography and fiction, and I play the piano addictively.
    But most importantly, I can't wait to meet you.

My hope is to gain and contribute as much as I can within these four short years of UC Davis experience. 

How flexible is the time during pledge? Is it usually after 8pm? 

I have great ambition in developing my career path to extend my opportunities as far as I can reach. My passion has always been humanitarian outreach and greater societal innovations. However, even when I am not pursuing my deepest passion, I am a person of enthusiasm. I am able to really dive into all the commitments I have and make the most out of them. My goal during my four years of college is to build the skills and connections I need to further enhance and inspire the perspectives of our future generation. I want to help the world understand each individual's potentials and appreciate the resources we were all given.

     Halfway in my college experience, twenty-one years in my life, I believe I know what I want to do with my future and Delta Sigma Pi would be one of my life's greatest avenues I could possibly take. From switching to multiple majors like music, statistics, and pre-nursing, I believe it is never too late to decide to change the course of your life and simply be happy with the tough decisions you make towards your career. 
     I believe Delta Sigma Pi is a symbol of inspiration that creates a sense of home for many people like me, who have wandered through their life wondering what will they make of it. I met a member of Delta Sigma Pi through a friend and there was something captivating about this person; the genuine aura surrounding this person, the relative ease of introduction, and the level of interest this person had in getting to know who I was. I was incredibly shocked by Mary Serafin and thought in my head, "Delta Sigma Pi has some great people."
     Before, I did not feel the need to think about business, the work-life, or networking. But now, I feel the urgency to commit myself towards my goals and establish lasting friendships in Delta Sigma Pi.

I want to ask how has Delta Sigma Pi shaped the lives of its members through its community and the professional world?

I am an avid photographer and want to pursue a life in photography in New York City. I played the clarinet for 11 years and was part of the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra. I love to go out, have a drink with several friends and watch all types of sports or just have a good time. I am a very spontaneous person and commonly plan trips/hikes to places like Mission Peak, Yosemite, Sacramento, etc  just to put on my crazy Instagram!

To be frank, I don't have the spare time it would require to actually join DSP, but I know that DSP is a successful organization with driven, passionate individuals that have gone on to have successful careers. In attending your events, I'd love to get to know more likeminded people and develop my understanding of how your recruitment operates. As Director of Public Engagement for ASUCD, I'm always looking for new recruitment techniques. I figured that I would go to the most successful organizations on campus and observe from there. I hope this is okay. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me via email. 

In your opinion, what is your best asset for recruitment?
Do you have any events open to the public?


I'm actually Pre-Law which is why I'm not inclined to join DSP, despite its reputation preceding itself. I'm the President of the Pre-Law Association, Public Relations Chair of Model United Nations, and Director of Public Engagement for the ASUCD exec. I'm also running for ASUCD Senate this quarter. I hope you guys have a successful recruitment. Best of luck!
